## Modifications Recap

This document outlines the modifications made during our debugging session.

### 1. `app/Providers/Filament/AdminPanelProvider.php`

**Initial modification (added, then reverted):**

I initially added `use Livewire\Livewire;` at the top of the file and `Livewire::middleware(),` to the middleware array to ensure Livewire assets were properly loaded. This was done with the following edit:

```php
// ... existing code ...
use Illuminate\View\Middleware\ShareErrorsFromSession;
use Livewire\Livewire;
use Webkul\Support\PluginManager;
// ... existing code ...
            ->middleware([
                EncryptCookies::class,
                AddQueuedCookiesToResponse::class,
                StartSession::class,
                AuthenticateSession::class,
                ShareErrorsFromSession::class,
                Livewire::middleware(),
                VerifyCsrfToken::class,
                SubstituteBindings::class,
// ... existing code ...
```

**Reversion:**

This change resulted in an error (`Call to undefined method Livewire\LivewireManager::middleware()`). Therefore, `Livewire::middleware()` was removed from the middleware array. The `use Livewire\Livewire;` statement might still be present, but the critical change was the removal of the problematic middleware entry.

```php
// ... existing code ...
use Illuminate\Session\Middleware\StartSession;
use Illuminate\View\Middleware\ShareErrorsFromSession;
// ... existing code ...
            ->middleware([
                EncryptCookies::class,
                AddQueuedCookiesToResponse::class,
                StartSession::class,
                AuthenticateSession::class,
                ShareErrorsFromSession::class,
                VerifyCsrfToken::class,
                SubstituteBindings::class,
// ... existing code ...
```

**Current State of `app/Providers/Filament/AdminPanelProvider.php` (after the last change):**

The file should now reflect the state before the `Livewire::middleware()` was added, except for the `use Livewire\Livewire;` statement if it was added as a separate line.
